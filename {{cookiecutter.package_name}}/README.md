## Project / Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

#### pipenv

This project uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to manage Python package dependencies. `pipenv` is a less
cumbersome mangagement utility that wraps the functionality of `virtualenv`. It is important for all developers to
become familiar with this utility to contribute to this project, but it's not necessary to get started.

_To get started... Run this one-time project setup task._
```shell
make project.setup
```

_To run a command within the `virtualenv` context..._
```shell
pipenv run your_command
```

_To spawn a shell within the `virtualenv`... Doing this eliminates the need for `pipenv run ...` before each command._
```shell
pipenv shell
```

### Environment Variables

| ENV_VAR                   | Description                                           | Default       |
| -------                   | -----------                                           | -------       |
|                           |                                                       |               |
