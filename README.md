# cookiecutter-python-pkg

This project is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) project / repository template for
creating a Python package. Unlike most things in the Python universe, this project is opinionated and utilizes, in my
opinion, the best-of-breed utilities and tooling for the job. As my opinions change, this project will change too.
Feedback is welcomed.
